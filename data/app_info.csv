dishwasher,"Dishwashers use between 1200 and 2400 watts of power, with an average dishwasher using 1800 watts. Dishwashers will typically use less water than hand washing if you are washing a full load of dishes. Always fully load your dishwasher, it will use the same amount of energy and water as washing less. Avoid the heat drying cycle in a dishwasher, instead leave your dishes to air dry it will help conserve energy."
washer,"A washing machine will use 400 to 1300 watts, with modern Energy Star rated models using about 500 watts. It is highly recommended to wash clothes in cold water, heating water will increase the cost substantially. Modern front loading washing machines use over 50% to 60% less water, it is recommended to upgrade if you are still using an older top loading model. Not only will use save money on water but if you do need to heat the water to wash your clothes you will need to heat less water which will save you energy."
dryer,"The energy use of a dryer varies between 1800 watts and 5000 watts, a typical dryer will use around 3000 watts. The best way to reduce energy use when drying clothes or towels is to hang dry them, this will avoid the clothes dryer all together. If you have a backyard or a balcony setup some hang lines and hang your clothes to dry, you will save energy and money. During winter it may not be possible to hang dry clothes, in that case using a dryer might be required. We recommend not to fully over dry clothes, instead dry your clothes until they are almost dry and hang them up in the house to dry completely."
laptop,"When charging the laptop battery power consumption will increase 10 to 20 percent, we estimate that 60 watts is average power consumption for a 14-15 inch laptop when plugged in. Laptops, notebooks and netbooks are a great choice for computers if you are interested in lower power consumption, plus they have a benefit of mobility. Similar to desktop computers enabling power saving features such as sleep or standby modes will reduce the energy use of your portable computer."
tv,"The power consumption of computer or tv displays vary significantly based on the display technology used, manufacturer and build quality, the size of the screen, what the display is showing (static versus moving images), brightness of the screen and if power saving settings are activated. LED & LCD screens use the same TFT LCD (thin film transistor liquid crystal display) technology for displaying images on the screen, when a product mentions LED it is referring to the backlighting. Older LCD monitors used CCFL (cold cathode fluorescent) backlighting which is generally 20-30% less power efficient compared to LED-backlit LCD displays."
